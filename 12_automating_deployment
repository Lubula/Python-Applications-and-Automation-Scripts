#  Python script that automates the deployment of a web application to a server using SSH:
# Paramiko: It's a Python library that provides SSH2 protocol support for Python.
# Function takes parameters such as host, username, password, local_path (path to the local application), and remote_path (path to deploy on the server).
# Establishes an SSH connection to the server using Paramiko.
# Uploads the local application files to the remote server using SFTP.
# Executes deployment commands remotely.
# Closes the SSH connection once deployment is completed or if an error occurs.

# Streamlined Deployment: Automating the deployment process saves time and reduces human error, ensuring consistent deployments across environments.
# Efficiency: Allows for quick and reliable deployments, especially in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
# Consistency: By automating deployments, companies can ensure that the deployment process is repeatable and standardized.
# Scalability: As companies scale their infrastructure and deploy more applications, automation becomes crucial for managing deployments efficiently.
# Companies adopting DevOps practices as it helps streamline and automate the deployment process, enabling faster delivery of software updates and new features.
