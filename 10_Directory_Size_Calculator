# Recursive Script: Directory Size Calculator
# recursively calculates the total size of a directory and its subdirectories.
# Companies often need to analyze storage usage for various purposes such as capacity planning and optimization. 
# This script provides a simple way to recursively calculate directory sizes, making it a handy tool for sysadmins and DevOps engineers

    total_size = 0
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            total_size += os.path.getsize(file_path)
    return total_size

# Usage
directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
total_size_bytes = calculate_directory_size(directory_path)
